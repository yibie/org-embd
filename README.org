[[org-embd:pdf:/path/to/document.pdf]]
#+end_example

In addition to directly entering links, you can also use the interactive command:

#+begin_src
M-x org-embd-video
#+end_src

Then enter the video URL or file path, for example:

- YouTube: =https://youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID= or =https://youtu.be/VIDEO_ID=

Then enter the local path of the PDF file.

* Customization

You can customize the default dimensions of the content through the following variables:

#+begin_src elisp
(setq org-embd-video-width 800)     ; Default is 640
(setq org-embd-video-height 450)    ; Default is 360
(setq org-embd-webpage-width 1024)  ; Default is 800
(setq org-embd-webpage-height 768)  ; Default is 600

(setq org-embd-pdf-height 1200)     ; Default is 1000
#+end_src

* Extension

You can add support for more content types by adding new rules:

#+begin_src elisp
(org-embd-register-rule 'my-platform
                        #'my-platform-matcher
                        #'my-platform-handler)
#+end_src

Where:
- =my-platform-matcher= is a function that takes a URL and returns non-nil if it can handle the URL
