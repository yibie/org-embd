Place this package in your Emacs load path, then add the following to your configuration file:

* Usage

Click on the link or use =C-c C-o= to open embedded content.

** Link Format

You can directly enter links in the following format in your Org file:

#+begin_example
[[org-embed:type:URL-or-path]]
#+end_example

Where:
- =type= can be =video=, =local-video=, =webpage=, or =pdf=
- =URL-or-path= is the address or file path of the content to embed

For example:
#+begin_example
[[org-embed:video:https://youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID]]
[[org-embed:local-video:/path/to/video.mp4]]
[[org-embed:webpage:https://example.com]]
[[org-embed:pdf:/path/to/document.pdf]]
#+end_example

** Embedding Online Videos

In addition to directly entering links, you can also use the interactive command:

#+begin_src
M-x org-embed-video
#+end_src

Then enter the video URL, for example:

- YouTube: =https://youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID= or =https://youtu.be/VIDEO_ID=
- Bilibili: =https://bilibili.com/video/BVID=
- Vimeo: =https://vimeo.com/VIDEO_ID=
- Dailymotion: =https://dailymotion.com/video/VIDEO_ID=
- TED: =https://ted.com/talks/TALK_ID=

** Embedding Local Videos

For local video files, use the dedicated command:

#+begin_src
M-x org-embed-local-video
#+end_src

Then enter the path to your local video file (mp4, webm, ogv, mov, mkv, avi).

** Embedding Webpages

#+begin_src
M-x org-embed-webpage
#+end_src

Then enter the webpage URL.

** Embedding PDFs

#+begin_src
M-x org-embed-pdf
#+end_src

Then enter the local path of the PDF file.

* Customization

You can customize the default dimensions of the content through the following variables:

#+begin_src elisp
(setq org-embed-video-width 800)     ; Default is 640
(setq org-embed-video-height 450)    ; Default is 360
(setq org-embed-webpage-width 1024)  ; Default is 800
(setq org-embed-webpage-height 768)  ; Default is 600
(setq org-embed-pdf-width 800)       ; Default is 800
(setq org-embed-pdf-height 1200)     ; Default is 1000
#+end_src

* Extension

You can add support for more content types by adding new rules:

#+begin_src elisp
(org-embed-register-rule 'my-platform
                        #'my-platform-matcher
                        #'my-platform-handler)
#+end_src

Where:
- =my-platform-matcher= is a function that takes a URL and returns non-nil if it can handle the URL
- =my-platform-handler= is a function that takes a URL, width, and height, and returns the embedded HTML content

* ⚠️KNOWN ISSUES

- incompatibility with org-modern-mode
When using org-embed, please note that it may not display properly if org-modern-mode is enabled. If you encounter display issues, try disabling org-modern-mode.

* File Structure

- =org-embed.el= - Main entry file
- =org-embed-core.el= - Core functionality module
- =org-embed-rules.el= - Content processing rule set

* Dependencies

- Emacs 25.1 or higher
- Emacs compiled with xwidget-webkit support

* Cleaning Embedded Content

You can use the following commands to clean up embedded content:

#+begin_src
M-x org-embed-clean-xwidget-at-point  ; Clean up embedded content at cursor
M-x org-embed-clean-all               ; Clean up all embedded content in the current buffer
#+end_src

**Note**: When using `org-embed-clean-xwidget-at-point`, make sure your cursor is positioned before or at the xwidget you want to clean. If the cursor is not at a xwidget, the function will search forward for the next xwidget.
